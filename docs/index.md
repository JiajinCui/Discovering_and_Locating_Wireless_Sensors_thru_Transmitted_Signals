# Abstract

Our project uses USRP N210 Hardware Drives (UHD) and GNU Radio to collect signals being transmitted by differnt smart home sensors using different communication protocols such as WiFi, Zigbee, Z-Wave, etc. We use a spectrum sensing model called Stitching-the-Spectrum to identify and locate those sensors without prior knowledge of their exact locations or functions. We plan to develop a system that autonomously discovers and identifies wireless sensors in a smart home by analyzing RF signals, MAC addresses and communication protocols. Eventually we will localize those sensors by applying geometry with the difference between Received Signal Strength Indicator we receive from differnt locations using multiple USRP N210 as the receivers.
