# Abstract

Our project uses USRP N210 Hardware Drives (UHD) and GNU Radio to collect signals from smart home sensors of communication protocols such as WiFi, Zigbee, Z-Wave, etc. We use a data generation pipeline called Stitching-the-Spectrum to turn raw signal data into processed signal banks with which we train a Deep Learning Classifier. We plan to develop a system that autonomously discovers and identifies wireless sensors in a smart home by analyzing wireless signals and communication protocols.
