# Abstract

Our project uses USRP N210 Hardware Drives (UHD) and GNU Radio to collect signals being transmitted by differnt smart home sensors using different communication protocols such as WiFi, Zigbee, Z-Wave, etc. We use a spectrum sensing model called Stitching-the-Spectrum to identify and those sensors without prior knowledge of their functions. We plan to develop a system that autonomously discovers and identifies wireless sensors in a smart home by analyzing RF signals, MAC addresses and communication protocols using a Deep Learning Classification model.
